      "2021-06-04\n",
      "TEHRAN - In a live televised speech on the anniversary of Imam Khomeini's demise, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei underlined the strength of the Islamic Republic of Iran, saying that the establishment got stronger by the day despite predictions on part of the enemies that it will collapse.\n",
      "\n",
      "  “I start the discussion from here that among the revolutionary systems and establishments that have been formed in the last one or two centuries, I do not know of any system as much as the Islamic Republic that has been predicted to collapse,” he said on Friday. “From the first day of the revolution, the ill-wishers and those who could not digest and tolerate this great phenomenon, both inside and outside the country, said that the Islamic Republic would not last for another two months, six months or a year.” \n",
      "  He noted, “It was one or two years ago when the esteemed Americans said the same thing and a high-ranking American official stated that the Islamic Republic would not see its 40th anniversary. I do not remember so many predictions of decay and collapse to have been made about any other system.” \n",
      "  Ayatollah Khamenei was apparently referring to former US national security advisor John Bolton's infamous prediction while addressing a terrorist MKO convention in Paris in 2017, according to Press TV. \n",
      "  Bolton had said, “The outcome of the president’s policy review should be to determine that the Ayatollah Khomeini’s 1979 revolution will not last until its 40th birthday. And that’s why, before 2019, we here will celebrate in Tehran.” \n",
      "  “But, thank God, the revolution and the system of Imam Khomeini not only did not collapse and did not stop, but became stronger day by day,\" Ayatollah Khamenei stated. \n",
      "  “It did not surrender, did not give up and rather showed its independence day by day. It achieved great success and overcame obstacles,” he continued. \n",
      "  Ayatollah Khamenei also addressed the key to the Islamic Republic’s durability, saying that despite various challenges, the Islamic Republic managed to survive and it is today “more developed than 40 years ago and is ahead in all respects by the grace of God.” \n",
      "  “The key to the Islamic Republic's permanency is in the two words ‘Islamic’ and ‘Republic.’ Our magnanimous Imam's great act was that he created and actualized this idea of an Islamic Republic. The base for the realization of that theory was his deep knowledge of Islam and people,” he said of the keys to the Islamic Republic's permanency. \n",
      "  The leader also addressed the youth, saying that it is hard for them to feel the pre-revolution era. He recalled that during the Shah regime, people had no role in determining their destiny. \n",
      "  “The Imam brought the people to the field with a leaping movement. The nation believed in itself and the Imam used the great capacity of the nation's ability and will, and with his leadership and guidance, he was able to take it to a stage where he could do great things,” Ayatollah Khamenei. \n",
      "  There was a time, the Leader continued, when the Islamic Republic was a sapling, and now it is a robust tree that cannot be uprooted by any storm. \n",
      "  Ayatollah Khamenei called Iran's religious democracy a “divine gift”, but warned of plots by the enemies to undermine it. \n",
      "  “Thank God, after the departure of the Imam, the Iranian nation preserved this divine gift and this religious democracy,\" he said. \n",
      "  \"The enemies of Iran, who made all kinds of efforts to separate the people and make them lose belief in religious democracy, had their plot thwarted and every time they tried a new way they faced the steel barrier of the Iranian people,” the Leader said. \n",
      "  “It is the same today. The enemies are lying in ambush to drive a wedge between the people and the Islamic system, but they are facing the steel barrier of the Iranian people. They plotted both security and intellectual invasion, all of which failed.” \n",
      "  Ayatollah Khamenei said there are some people inside Iran, who either knowingly or unknowingly repeat the claims of the enemies. \n",
      "  “The idea that democracy does not go hand in hand with religion is also the claim of the enemies. Of course, some may say this out of negligence. They should know that this is the talk of the enemy and the enemy wants to eradicate Islam… It is a great mistake if we alienate democracy from Islamic thought and spirit.” \n",
      "  The Leader also pointed to the importance of participating in the upcoming presidential election. “All individuals should feel it to be their duty to not only take part in the elections but also to enjoin others to do so. This is enjoining the truth,” he pointed out.\n",

      "Senior Iranian diplomat elaborates on Salehi’s letter to IAEA chief\n",
      "2021-06-02\n",
      "TEHRAN - Iran’s envoy to the International Atomic Energy Agency, Kazem Gharibabadi, has given more details about the letter that Iran’s nuclear chief sent to IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The letter, sent via Gharibabadi, contained details about Iran’s decision to announce the expiration of a technical understanding between Iran and the IAEA. \n",
      "  The letter was announced after the Agency released a quarterly report on Iran in which it accused Iran of failing to explain traces of uranium found at several allegedly undeclared sites. The letter also came after Grossi announced on May 24 that he had agreed with Iran to extend by one month a February deal between Iran and the IAEA allowing the UN nuclear watchdog to continue necessary monitoring activities. \n",
      "  However, Gharibabadi said on Twitter that Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), in his letter, told Grossi that the monitoring deal has expired. \n",
      "  “Dr. Salehi's letter to @rafaelmgrossi: Whereas the Technical Understanding was expired on May 24, Iran decided not to extend it, meanwhile we decided to continue recording for one month aimed at providing another opportunity to conclude bilateral tech negotiations with the Agency,” Gharibabadi said on Twitter, adding, “On safeguards, Iran has so far done its utmost efforts to cooperate with the Agency substantively and provide the necessary clarifications and responses. We welcome the Agency’s readiness for engaging in a proactive and focused effort to resolve the issues without any delay.” \n",
      "  According to Fars News, the Iranian diplomat also said, “And as before, we would continue to cooperate constructively with the Agency. We highly expect such a mutual determination would result in reaching a visible practical outcome as quickly as possible.” \n",
      "  Gharibabadi provided more details about the letter in an interview with Iran’s TV. “We delivered this letter to the Director General of the Agency yesterday, which addresses two issues. One [aspect of the letter] is about a joint agreement we had with the Agency to record data from some of the Agency's surveillance cameras for three months without providing the data to the Agency, and if we reach an agreement on nuclear issues and the outcome as well as the lifting of sanctions after three months, then we will provide information to the Agency,” he said. \n",
      "  According to Gharibabadi, safeguards issues constitute another aspect of the letter. “The letter explicitly states that Iran has all kinds of interactions and cooperation with the IAEA and that we are still ready to work with the IAEA to resolve a number of safeguards issues, but the IAEA must work with a neutral and non-political approach to conclude these issues as soon as possible,” he noted. \n",
      "  Underlining that the AEOI-IAEA deal expired on May 24, the Iranian diplomat said, “There were contacts and requests from the Agency and the countries that are negotiating with us in the framework of the JCPOA talks to extend this understanding for another period. This issue was examined internally and the conclusion was that this understanding could not be legally extended, but the Islamic Republic of Iran decided to continue recording data for another month in its own good faith and as an independent decision and not a legal decision.” \n",
      "  He added, “What happens next month and what we do with this data is an independent sovereign decision that takes into account a number of factors, including the Agency's approach and technical approaches, especially in negotiations with us on safeguards as well as political negotiations in the field of the JCPOA.” \n",
      "  Gharibabadi also commented on the IAEA quarterly report on Iran. “The Director-General of the Agency released two quarterly reports yesterday for next week's meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors, one on verifying the implementation of the JCPOA in Iran and the other on a number of remaining safeguards disputed between Iran and the IAEA,” he continued. \n",
      "  “The entire JCPOA report is influenced by the decision we made to the Agency on February 15, 2021, stating that from 23 February we will cease all voluntary and transparent activities under the JCPOA. Our decision followed the implementation of the strategic law of the Islamic Consultative Assembly on the lifting of all sanctions and the protection of the rights of the nation. After that, all voluntary actions, including the implementation of the Additional Protocol in Iran, came to a halt,” the Iranian diplomat said, adding, “This report lists verification restrictions in more than a dozen cases, and this report indicates that Iran's decision and the law of the Islamic Consultative Assembly have been well implemented in this regard. Another point reflected in the JCPOA report is that this report acknowledges that Iran's nuclear activities, especially in the two areas of new machines and enrichment, i.e. both the level of enrichment and enrichment up to 5%, up to 20% and up to 60% as well as the stockpile or the amount of uranium we enrich, continue as before.” \n",
      "  He stated that there has been no suspension of Iran's nuclear activities, adding, “The parliamentary law and Iran's decision to suspend voluntary activities are underway and all nuclear activities in various fields continue, and the Agency report confirms this. Of course, due to the fact that the Agency, because of our decision, did not have access to its own monitoring equipment and we suspended some of its beyond-safeguards access, some of the statistics the Agency published about the activities are estimates of the Agency and some of the statistics in the Agency report on the JCPOA are the result of the Agency's safeguards-related verifications, which is not prohibited.” \n",
      "  Gharibabadi added, “In the second report released by the Agency on safeguards, you are aware that we have about three or four disputes concerning safeguards with the Agency. We repeatedly told the Agency that these issues are not so important and complicated that the Agency wants to make them an important agenda for the International Atomic Energy Agency. It is claimed, for example, that some activities took place about two decades ago. The Agency took samples and some contaminants were found in one or two places, and we are working with the Agency to clear up these ambiguities.” \n",
      "  He also warned the IAEA against adopting a political approach to cooperation between Iran and the UN body in the midst of the nuclear negotiations over the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). \n",
      "  If the Agency continues to turn insignificant issues into political agenda, Gharibabadi warned, Iran will change its behavior with the international body accordingly. \n",
      "  “The international community now suffers from concerns about the proliferation and existence of nuclear weapons in the hands of some regimes, such as the insane Israeli regime. What has the Agency done about this regime? While this regime is not a member of any of the disarmament institutions and disarmament and arms control treaties, the Agency has never put pressure on Israel,” Gharibabadi continued. \n",
      "  The Iranian diplomat pointed out, “This regime has weapons and threatens to use them. Now you want to turn two or three old issues from more than two decades ago, which are very insignificant and worthless, into a political agenda in the case of Iran, which in 2020, according to a recent Agency report accepted more than 20 percent of the Agency inspections worldwide. This is not something that we can ignore. We will definitely pay attention to it and adjust our behavior.” \n",
      "  He added, “We explicitly sent this message to the director general of the Agency, and yesterday I sent a serious warning in the form of a message to the director general of the Agency and head of the safeguards department, not to abuse Iran's goodwill and behavior, and to address the serious concerns the international community facing in the proliferation sphere. A prominent example of those concerns is the Israeli regime.”\n",

      "\n",
      "  The population that, not too long ago, was among the world's youngest is according to some estimates going to be among the eldest in two decades if the fertility rate remains low. The Iranian Health Ministry says the rate among Iranian women has dropped 25% just over the past four years. \n",
      "  Based on statistics, the decline in birth rates inIranover the past few years means the number of babies born each year is now around 1.6 percent per woman. That’s well below the 2.1 percent replacement fertility level necessary to sustain population. \n",
      "  The director general of the ministry’s department of population, family and school health described this downward trend as extremely worrisome.

      "  For years, there have been talks between Iranian and Iraqi officials to jointly restore the magnificent structure, but nothing happened. Even Iranian archaeologists have repeatedly asked the Iranian authorities to consult on the restoration of the monument in cooperation between the two countries.

      "  Known in classical times as Ecbatana, Hamedan was one of the ancient world’s greatest cities. Pitifully little remains from antiquity, but significant parts of the city center are given over to excavations, and there’s a scattering of historical curiosities. \n",
      "  Hamedan never falls short of offering cultural heritage sites to its visitors. Scenic natural landscapes, traditional restaurants, public gardens, and colorful outdoor markets, and more importantly, its hospitable people make for an unexpected slice of the city. \n",

      "TEHRAN – The design of contemporary cities should incorporate intangible cultural aspects of the nation, deputy tourism minister Mohammad-Hassan Talebian has said. \n",
      "\n",
      "  He made the remarks during an international webinar on contemporary architecture and intangible cultural heritage, which was held in Tehran Intangible Cultural Heritage Center on Monday. \n",
      "  For the dynamism and vitality of contemporary cities, the intangible cultural heritage capacities must be emphasized more than ever, he explained. \n",
      "  In this regard, traditional and indigenous knowledge as a source of spiritual and material capital and its positive contribution to sustainable development seems crucial, he added. \n",
      "  For his part, Mostafa Purali, a senior official with the Ministry of Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts said that throughout the last two centuries, human attitudes toward themselves, their environment, and their living space have changed, creating a new kind of architectural space. \n",
      "  Despite the strengths of this type of architectural space, it must be admitted that contemporary architecture has its limitations, including the lack of an appropriate basis for intangible cultural elements to emerge and develop, he added. \n",
      "  Architecture and the city can share a memorable quality if they make use of intangible cultural heritage, which is being preserved through customs, performances, rituals, handicrafts, and language, he explained. \n",
      "  The intangible cultural heritage of a nation consists of its practices, symbols, skills, means, traditional knowledge, handicrafts, and cultural spaces passed down from one generation to the next. \n",
      "  Among Iran’s intangible cultural heritage are performing arts, traditional and hand-made crafts, skills related to these crafts, social traditions, customs, celebrations, rituals, science and customs related to nature and world, verbal traditions, and other manifestations such as languages. \n",

      "2021-06-02\n",
      "TEHRAN – Sistan-Baluchestan is further moving towards inscribing its ancient windmills on the UNESCO list as commencing an aerial mapping project as a preliminary stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "  “We are completing a dossier for a selection of Asbads (windmills) of the province for a [possible] UNESCO registration… and during the recent months, this process has been accelerated,” deputy provincial tourism chief Mansoureh Molla'elahi said on Tuesday. \n",
      "  Aerial mapping of these valuable works has been commenced for seven sites of Asbad, which are expected to be collectively registered on the prestigious list with those located in the provinces of Razavi Khorasan and South Khorasan. \n",
      "  Made of natural clay, straw, and wood, an Asbad is typically comprised of eight chambers, with each chamber housing six blades. As the area’s strong, steady wind enters the chambers it turns the blades, which then turn grindstones. The structures reach up to about 65 feet in height. \n",
      "  The Asbad used to be a smart technique to grind grains. It also bears testimony to the human being’s adaption with nature by transforming environmental obstacles into opportunities. “Asbad is a smart technique to grind grains, a technique which goes back to ancient times when the people living in the eastern parts of Iran, in an attempt to adapt themselves with nature and transform environmental obstacles into opportunities, managed to invent it,” according to UNESCO website. \n",
      "  “The earliest known references to windmills are to a Persian millwright in 644 CE and windmills in Seistan [Sistan], Iran, in 915 CE,” the Encyclopedia Britannica says. \n",
      "  Avid visitors and researchers can examine the subtle yet simple mechanism in person as several windmills have been restored and brought back to life to testify how ancient Iranians harnessed the wind to make a living. \n",
      "  The Islamic Republic designated the Asbad as a national heritage site in 2002. \n",
