      "Responding to the Office for National Statistics data on the ethnic contrast in deaths involving COVID-19, Senior Research Fellow, Mehrunisha Suleman, said:\n",
      "\n",
      "'There is no doubt that ethnic minority communities have been hit harder by the COVID-19 crisis and have faced higher risk of death. As part of our ongoing COVID-19 impact inquiry, we have gathered compelling evidence into how existing inequalities have worsened, with ethnic minority communities more likely to be working outside of the home, using public transport or living in overcrowded accommodation, increasing the risk of virus transmission.\n",
      "\n",
      "'As we seek to recover from the pandemic, it is essential that the Government addresses the ways in which racial discrimination and economic disadvantage have disproportionately impacted these communities. While the speed of the vaccine roll-out is encouraging, we need to ensure all communities have confidence in and can easily access vaccines, particularly in the South Asian community where mortality was higher in the second wave. This will ensure that no groups are left behind.'\n",

      "\n",
      "'Today’s report is right to highlight that improving health across the country should be a key measure of success for the levelling up agenda. With the focus so far on boosting infrastructure and skills, a healthy population is also essential for economic recovery and prosperity.  \n",
      "\n",
      "'It is good the government acknowledges the need to address inequalities in its ambition to 'level up'. The next step must be to set out a coherent strategy to achieve this, building on the initial policies and funding announced yesterday. Such a strategy must include a clear path to reducing avoidable and costly ill health – including mental health – assessed against measurable goals and metrics. Without that, avoidable ill-health will be a drag on future prosperity.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The strategy for levelling up must be cross-government owned, with both the Cabinet Office and Number 10 taking overall responsibility. It should tackle the most important factors that influence our health – including poverty, unemployment, low quality work, inadequate early years support, and housing – targeting areas of the country where healthy life expectancy has been deteriorating. It is time to get much more serious about health. If not now after a pandemic, when?\n",
      "\n",
      "'Local government has a central role to play in addressing these ‘wider determinants’ of health, and it will be important to link a strategy for levelling up with any new plans to develop devolution within England. The report rightly highlights our call to reverse cuts to local authorities’ public health grant, which has been reduced by a quarter since 2014/15. The underfunding of public health services has undermined the resilience of our poorest communities and further entrenched geographical inequalities.'\n",

      "Responding to the report by the Health and Social Care Select Committee on the Government’s White Paper proposals for the reform of Health and Social Care, Hugh Alderwick, Head of Policy for the Health Foundation, said: \n",
      "\n",
      "‘The Select Committee's report highlights major gaps in the government’s health and care reform agenda. We agree with the committee that greater collaboration between the NHS, local government, and others has the potential to improve local services, but there are still big unanswered questions about what new integrated care systems are, what they will do, and how they will be held to account. There is also a risk of disruption and distraction at a time when local services are trying to recover from the pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The enduring silence on social care reform is deafening and this week’s Queen’s Speech provided no further detail. The need for fundamental reform of adult social care in England has been well articulated for decades, yet successive governments have ducked reform and people and their families continue to suffer unnecessarily. Delaying any further means government choosing to prolong major public policy failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "'We support the Committee’s recommendation for a clause in the forthcoming Health and Care Bill to improve workforce planning in health and social care by publishing independent and transparent projections of how many staff we need for the future. Workforce issues in the NHS and social care are chronic, yet the Government’s White Paper said almost nothing about how they will be addressed. Legislation must be combined with a long-term plan for supporting and expanding the workforce and additional funding to deliver it.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The Government’s proposals to increase the power of the Secretary of State over the health service have little rationale and risk greater politicisation of the NHS. Government must clearly articulate the perceived benefits of the proposed changes for patients and staff, how additional powers will be used, and what checks and balances will be in place to ensure they are used as intended.'\n",

      "'The NHS is beginning to show promising signs of recovery after the extreme strain placed on it by COVID-19. The numbers of people being referred and treated for cancer is now above pre-pandemic levels, while important progress has been made towards getting routine hospital procedures back on track.\n",

      "\n",
      "'Ongoing under-investment in the NHS and social care made them vulnerable to national emergencies like COVID-19.

      "\n",
      "'Today’s Queen’s speech shows a welcome recognition by the government that COVID-19 will cast a long shadow over the NHS. But the scale and depth of impact of the pandemic on the NHS is immense. The Health and Care Bill may help improve collaboration between services but it will not fix the most urgent issues facing the service, with critical workforce shortages and a huge backlog of unmet need for care. Without significant investment in the workforce, infrastructure and technology, the backlog won’t be addressed quickly and the public will experience avoidable long waits for care.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It is a huge disappointment that the government still has no plan for social care, letting down the many people needing social care support, their families, social care staff and providers. The Treasury’s objection that reform is unaffordable does not stand up to scrutiny, with pragmatic and workable solutions on the table that would cost just 2% of what we currently pay for the NHS. Given the weight of the case for change, the question is not whether social care reform is affordable but whether the government can afford to delay progress on an issue that could become its Achilles heel.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The government’s stated desire to address inequalities through the levelling up agenda is welcome but plans for skills, jobs and infrastructure need to be delivered in ways that will improve the health and wellbeing of people across the UK. More than a third of 25-to 64-year-olds in the areas of England with the lowest healthy life expectancy are unable to work because of illness or disability. A lot of ill health is avoidable, and a healthy population is a key asset for long-term economic recovery. Direct investment in early years and family support, education, employment, housing and communities is crucial to improve health and ‘level up’ opportunity and prosperity for people living in all parts of the country.'\n",
